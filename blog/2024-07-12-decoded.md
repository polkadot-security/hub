This year at Polkadot Decoded, we are excited to announce the launch of the Polkadot Security Hub! This is the place to be if you are interested in security in the Polkadot ecosystem.

A introductory talk about security was given by Patricio Calderon, Security Team at Parity Technologies, to introduce this website and other tools that will help the community to improve the security of their projects. 

For now, check the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTGUiXxS5N7YFuoK3cxMYvXQJcXYKGT6AtAS0fni1XoSVLSz8sTXXXXZ8eKbRvLhq-GABPmOh9VLacz/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000), or in the embed below:

We are always looking for ways to improve, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know!

As soon as the Tech Talk is available, we will update this post with the video. Stay tuned!

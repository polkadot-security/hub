# Parathreat

Parathreat is a wargame centered on securing the Polkadot ecosystem, offering an array of missions for participants to navigate and conquer. With the initial mission ready for engagement and more on the horizon, the game covers extensive aspects of the Polkadot ecosystem, including parachains, pallets, and nodes within the Substrate framework. Participants are tasked with identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities across these diverse components, mirroring the real-world scenarios of threat detection and resolution.
